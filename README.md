# What is this?
An extremely old, likely-poorly-written BAT farming bot I wrote in JS to abuse Brave browser in 2021. At one point in life I really wanted to become a crypto-millionaire, though I'm not a crypto-nerd anymore - likely due to losing thousands because of it. One endeavor of that was to use an old laptop to cycle through webpages and accrue naturally generating BAT. I have no idea if this still works, but I don't use JS anymore, I likely won't pick it back up since I've switched gears to data, Python, and SQL, and either way this is likely a bad implementation IF it even works. 

I don't plan on keeping it on my desktop anymore, but I don't likely discarding virtual memories that easily, so I'm creating a repo for it here. If anyone finds any use in it, go nuts, if it works and you become a BAT millionaire, don't forget me please.
